# MiniGCS Benchmark Test Results

## Test Summary

**Test Configuration:**
- **Objects Tested**: 1,000 objects
- **Size Range**: 1KB - 10KB per object
- **Erasure Coding**: k=2, m=1 (2 data shards, 1 parity shard)
- **Nodes**: 3 nodes across different regions
- **Total Operations**: 2,000 operations (1,000 uploads + 1,000 downloads)

## Performance Metrics

### Upload Performance
- **Average Latency**: 3.02 ms
- **Median Latency**: 2.74 ms
- **Min Latency**: 1.79 ms
- **Max Latency**: 52.96 ms

### Download Performance
- **Average Latency**: 1.08 ms
- **Median Latency**: 0.69 ms
- **Min Latency**: 0.55 ms
- **Max Latency**: 53.42 ms

## Test Results Summary

- **Success Rate**: 100% (All 2,000 operations completed successfully)
- **Data Integrity**: Perfect - all uploads and downloads verified
- **Erasure Coding**: Working correctly with k=2, m=1 configuration
- **Multi-Region Replication**: 3-node setup functioning properly
